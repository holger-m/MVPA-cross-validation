# MVPA-cross-validation

Matlab code used to perform the MVPA cross-validation described in Sheffield J.M., Mohr H., Ruge H., Barch D.M., *Disrupted salience and cingulo-opercular network connectivity underlies impaired rapid instructed task learning in schizophrenia* (submitted). To start the analysis, run run_MVPA.m in Matlab. The analysis was performed using Matlab 2018b and libsvm 3.23.
